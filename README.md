# TikTok Project V: Machine Learning**

## Overview

**The purpose** of this model is to mitigate misinformation in videos on the TikTok platform.

**The goal** of this model is to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or presents an "opinion".

*This activity has three parts:*

**Part 1:** Ethical considerations
* Consider the ethical implications of the request

**Part 2:** Feature engineering
* Perform feature engineering: feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling

**Part 3:** Modeling
* Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps

## Introduction
This is the fifth part out of 5 projects. The Final purpose of the projects is to develop a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classifying and predicting if a video posted by a TikTok user is either a 'claim' or an 'opinion', In this project, we will use machine learning techniques to predict on a binary outcome variable.


## Data Sources
